# UJRA_Website
This is a website project I worked on almost the entire Summer 2017 for a young ONG that support young people 
specially in DRC for education through different events. The full name of this organization stands for
"Union of Young for the Success of the Future". The website is ready to be launch
any time. Moreover, a schedule for maintenance and update must be set up as soon as 
the site online.
